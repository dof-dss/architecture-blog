Today the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) published a set of [Enterprise Architecture Principles][1]{:class="govuk-link"}.

These principles will be used to guide the NICS when making decisions regarding business and technology innovation and change. The document was developed by the NICS Information and Technical Design Authority (ITDA). The ITDA will provide an enterprise architecture governance function for the NICS.

An [HTML version of the document][2]{:class="govuk-link"} is also available.
