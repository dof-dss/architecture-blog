At a meeting of the NICS Technical Design Group, members of the DSS Enterprise and Solution Architecture Team showed how GitHub can be used to store both code and the documentation that should accompany it.

A number of repository templates have been created to make storing your code and building your documentation really straight forward.

The DSS repositories can be found at [https://github.com/dof-dss](https://github.com/dof-dss).
