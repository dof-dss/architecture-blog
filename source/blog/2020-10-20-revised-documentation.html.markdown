DSS has reviewed and updated a number of websites, including this blog, to improve accessibility in line with [accessibility regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made), these are:

- [NICS Enterprise Architecture Principles](https://principles.ea.digitalni.gov.uk){:class="govuk-link"}
- [NICS Citizen Services Architecture](https://docs.ea.digitalni.gov.uk){:class="govuk-link"}

These websites have have been built [reusable components from Government Digital Service](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2018/12/07/updating-the-gds-technical-documentation-tool/) which use the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) to ensure we continue to make our content as accessible as possible.
