If I asked you to think about how you would make a building accessible, what would be the things that pop into your head?

Ramps, automatic doors…

Most people think of these things because they take building accessibility to mean designed with wheelchair users in mind. However, what about people with visual impairments who would benefit from braille signage, or people with hearing difficulties who need a visual clue to a fire alarm going off?

We need to have a more holistic view and look to make these things accessible to all; citizen services are no different.

I often hear people saying they want to make their service more accessible, this usually means they want to put it online. Yes, it may open it up to a wider audience yet it may also, if not built correctly, make it inaccessible to some of our users.

The Public Sector builds online services for use by all citizens of Northern Ireland; given at least [1 in 5 people in the UK have a long term illness, impairment or disability](https://www.scope.org.uk/media/disability-facts-figures){:class="govuk-link"} we have a moral obligation to make sure these services work for everyone no matter their personal circumstance.

## Web accessibility regulations

New [accessibility regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made){:class="govuk-link"} have come into force meaning that our moral obligation to make our web content and mobile apps accessible is now also a legal duty.

To ensure compliance you must do the following for all your web content (websites and web applications) and mobile apps, both internal and external:

- Check for accessibility issues against the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/){:class="govuk-link"}
- Make a plan to address those accessibility issues
- Publish an [accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement){:class="govuk-link"}

As with all legislation and regulations, there are deadlines to adhere to and the final one is looming large.

 - Public sector websites published on or after 23 September 2018 must be compliant by **23 September 2019**. Any websites published after this date must be compliant before going live.
- Public sector websites published before 23 September 2018 must be compliant by **23 September 2020**.
- Apps need to meet the regulations by **23 June 2021**.

## Useful resources

When trying to get my head around these new regulations, I found the GOV.UK and Home Office content invaluable to understanding the what, why and when, never mind the how. I hope these resources help bring you the same understanding to help you get your online content into shape for the 23rd September 2020. The ‘Designing for Accessibility’ posters from the Home Office are particularly thought provoking.
