Today the team launched the API Gateway.

The API Gateway makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs at any scale. API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorisation and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management.

We have chosen the [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway) as our API management platform for the next two years.
