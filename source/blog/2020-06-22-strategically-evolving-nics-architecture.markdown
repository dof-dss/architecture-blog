Today the team published a framework for strategically evolving the NICS architecture.  The strategy enables the continuing development of the NICS architecture to proceed in a purposful and strategically beneficial manner.

### Applying Enterprise Architecture principles in real life

The [NICS Enterprise Architecture principles](https://principles.ea.digitalni.gov.uk/) guide decisions and act as the basis for architecture development.  The framework specifically applies two principles - [1.4 Reuse over buy over build](https://principles.ea.digitalni.gov.uk/documentation/general/#1-4-reuse-before-buy-buy-before-build) and [4.5 Leverge multi-cloud provision](https://principles.ea.digitalni.gov.uk/documentation/technology/#4-5-leveraging-multi-cloud-provision ) - to guide the procuring and hosting of solutions.

### Procuring and hosting new applications

It is desired that new applications are procurred and hosted in a manner that places them in a "green" location, though "amber" locations are permitted.  New applications should not be targetting a procurement and hosting arrangement that places them in a "red" location.  

### Dispensations

It is expected that the vast majority of new applications will be able to adhere to the strategy outlined here.  There may be extenuating circumstances where this may not be possible.  If this is the case the project team should engage the Enterprise Architecture team for guidance and if necessary [dispensation](https://dss-architecture-portal.london.cloudapps.digital/governance/dispensation/) may be granted.
